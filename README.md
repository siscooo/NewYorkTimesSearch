# New York Times Search Engine

The New York Times Search Engine is a website that quickly searches for articles based on the keyword searched. It allows you to set a parameter of how many articles are shown, as well as adding optional search parameters such as the year of publication. 

Whenever a keyword is searched, the articles will populate at the bottom of the page. When you hit the Clear Results button, the articles will be removed and you can search again.
