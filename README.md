# New York Times Search Engine

The New York Times Search Engine is a website that quickly searches for articles based on the keyword searched. It allows you to set a parameter of how many articles are shown, as well as adding optional search parameters such as the year of publication. 

Whenever a keyword is searched, the articles will populate at the bottom of the page. When you hit the Clear Results button, the articles will be removed and you can search again.

This project was completed alongside Raphael Gako. We worked together on every aspect of the project assigned to us at The Coding Bootcamp at UCI.
